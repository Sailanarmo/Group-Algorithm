# Group-Algorithm

This Code will attempt to grab any n number of vertex's and store them in the smallest amount of containers possible. 
It will find the lowest minimum of the entire group, then find the biggest maximum for that group, group them and remove
it from the set. It will then repeat itself until it produces the smallest amount of containers needed.
